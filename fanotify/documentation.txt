Fanotify allows the user to set a directory as a mount point to watch.

Use the following command to set a mount point:
sudo mount --bind <dir> <dir>

Then run:
sudo ./logger

Output is created in logger's directory, in map.txt and log.txt.
map.txt contains (pid, process name) pairs in the format:
<pid>: <process name>
log.txt contains file access events in the format:
<filename> <"read"/"modified"/"opened"/"closed"> by process <pid>.
